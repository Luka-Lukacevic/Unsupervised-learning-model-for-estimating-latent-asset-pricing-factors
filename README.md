# Unsupervised-learning-model-for-estimating-latent-asset-pricing-factors

## Description
Within this bachelor thesis, it was necessary to develop an unsupervised learning model which estimates latent factors explaining the expectation and variance of a large collection of financial time series. First, a benchmark model based on principal component analysis needed to be built, focusing on the variability in the data. Then, the model needed to be expanded to include the requirements on explaining the expectations of the time series, as well as develop the estimation procedure for latent factors in the expanded model.
